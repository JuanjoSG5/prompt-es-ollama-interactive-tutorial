      "1.\tTry to have at least two example emails. Ollama doesn't need an example for all categories, and the examples don't have to be long. It's more helpful to have examples for whatever you think the trickier categories are (which you were asked to think about at the bottom of Chapter 6 Exercise 1). XML tags will help you separate out your examples from the rest of your prompt, although it's unnecessary.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
      "2.\tMake sure your example answer formatting is exactly the format you want Ollama to use, so Ollama can emulate the format as well. This format should make it so that Ollama's answer ends in the letter of the category. Wherever you put the {email} placeholder, make sure that it's formatted exactly like your example emails.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
